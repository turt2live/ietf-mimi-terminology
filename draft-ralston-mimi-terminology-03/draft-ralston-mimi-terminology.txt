1.  Introduction

   The More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) working group is
   chartered to specify the minimal set of mechanisms to make modern
   instant messaging applications interoperable.  Through prior
   discussions and upcoming documents, it's become important to have a
   shared understanding for what is being discussed specifically.

   This document expands upon MLS's [I-D.ietf-mls-protocol]
   [I-D.ietf-mls-architecture] terminology by defining terms specific to
   MIMI's purpose.  Document authors SHOULD prefix terms from MLS with
   "MLS" to denote where the term is specifically coming from.  For
   example, "MLS Group" versus "Group".  This document defines terms
   which are non-conflicting to help ensure clarity when the MLS prefix
   is missing, however.

   Documents within the MIMI working group may introduce their own
   terminology to explain concepts within their context.  Those
   documents SHOULD NOT override or change the terminology described in
   this document or from MLS.

2.  Terminology

   *TODO(TR): How much of this is replaced by [I-D.barnes-mimi-arch]?*

   MIMI defines:

   *Messaging Provider* or *Provider*: A service offering instant
   messaging to users.  Each provider has a server to route events
   between users (or clients, specifically).

   *User*: A (normally) human operator of a client.  Users have a *User
   ID* to identify them canonically within the system.

   *User Identity*: A mapping of *User ID* to external identifier, such
   as a phone number.  In some cases, the user identity can be
   synonymous with the user ID, however the default assumption if not
   clarified is that they are different concepts.

   *Client*: A user interface for messaging, performing encryption as
   needed.  Presents rooms to the user to interact with.  Synonymous
   with MLS Client.  Clients have a *Client ID* to canonically identify
   them among a user's other clients.  Clients can additionally be
   called *Devices* to differentiate them from a named application.

   *Room*: The place where users communicate.  This is semantically
   distinct from an MLS Group: an MLS Group is responsible for handling
   client keys while a room is simply the user-facing construct for
   communication, however systems can declare a Room to be the same as
   an MLS Group depending on their design.  Rooms have a *Room ID* to
   canonically identify them within the system.  Rooms can additionally
   be called *Chats*, *Conversations*, and *Channels*.

   A room can have any one of many different characterizations/
   behaviours, called *Room Types*:

   *  *DM*: A direct message room between exactly two users.  DMs are
      typically created when a user searches for another user to
      message, rather than creating a group Room.  All users in the room
      have the same permission capabilities under the access control
      semantics.  The room name is that of the other user in the DM.
      DMs are typically canonical: exactly one Room with the other user
      exists at a time.

   *  *Group DM*: A subtype of DMs where there are more than two users.
      The room name consists of the other users in the DM.  Inherited
      from DMs, Group DMs are also canonical: creating a new Group DM
      with the exact same users ultimately redirects to the existing
      room instead of creating a new one.  These may also be called *Ad-
      hoc Rooms* in some scenarios.

   *  *Group Chat*: A room which requires an invite to be able to
      participate, and can have zero or more users.  A user-provided
      room name is defined for the room.  Typically, the creator has
      admin permissions while other designated users have either admin
      permissions or moderator permissions.  Most users have default
      permissions which allow them to send events to the room.  Unlike
      (Group) DMs, multiple rooms with the same set of users can exist
      at the same time, even with the same room name.

   *  *Public Room*: A group chat which does not require an invite to
      participate.  Usually these types of rooms are discovered through
      a directory or website.  Rooms which require a request to join, or
      knock, are considered public rooms.  Sometimes these will be
      referred to as *Public Chatrooms*.

   *  *Auditorium Room*: Either a group chat or public room where most
      users are unable to send events and cannot be seen as room
      participants by other users.  When an event is sent, it may appear
      to be sent by the room itself rather than the specific user who
      sent it.  Sometimes these are called *Auditorium Chats*.

   Depending on the system, a room's type can be mutable.  For example,
   a user may be permitted to introduce new users to a group DM to
   implicitly convert it to a group room, or they simply may be unable
   to implicitly or explicity change the room type.

   *Room Name*: The title or human-focused textually distinguishing
   factor for the room.  It may be automatically generated based on the
   room participants.

   *Room Avatar*: A picture or graphic associated with the room, usually
   in combination with a room name.  Room avatars can be automatically
   generated based on the room participants.

   *Room Participant*: A joined user in the room.  Note that this may
   have implications on the associated MLS Members in the MLS Group for
   the user's devices.

   *Event*: The container for an encrypted MLS Message, sent over the
   wire between servers and clients (through their local servers).
   Events have an *Event ID* to canonically identify them at least
   within the room.

   *Room Property*: Information stored in the room, such as the name,
   topic, avatar, room participants, etc.  This may be in the shape of
   an event.  Note that room properties are different from what is
   needed to construct an MLS Group Context.

   *Message*: Synonymous with an MLS Message.  Messages have a *Message
   ID* to canonically identify them at least within the group.  These
   are essentially what a user would call a "message", though
   specifically the unencrypted portion.  When encrypted, they are
   called events.

   *Server*: Responsible for routing events to other servers and local
   clients.  The collection of servers and clients in a room form the
   MLS Delivery Service (DS).

   *Hub Server*: The specific server responsible for routing events to
   other servers in the context of a room.  Sometimes this is shortened
   to *Hub*.

   *Owning Server*: If applicable, the server specifically responsible
   for applying access control to a room.  Typically, this will also be
   the hub server for the room.  This should _not_ be shortened to
   "owner" to avoid confusion with other related concepts.

   *Client-Server API*: The interface between a client and server.  This
   may be nothing more than a function call if the client and server are
   the same logical entity.

   *Server-Server API*: The interface between a server and another
   server.

   *Transport*: The method and format for moving information between
   entities.  For example, a Client-Server API might describe HTTPS and
   JSON as its transport.  For added clarity, documents should clarify
   which API surface they are defining a transport for ("Server-Server
   Transport", for example).  MIMI is not chartered to define the
   Client-Server Transport.

   *Message Format*: The specific format that clients use within the
   encrypted body of an MLS Message.  Sometimes this will also be called
   the *Content Format*.

   *Access Control*: The set of algorithms which determine whether an
   event or MLS Message is permitted in the room/group.  For instance,
   this may define whether an MLS Proposal is accepted or whether the
   user is able to become a room participant.

   *Admin Permissions*: Typically at least the user who created the
   room, these permissions grant the associated users an ability to
   change the permissions of other users in the room.  The set of users
   with these permissions in a room are called *Admins*. Admin
   permissions typically inherit moderator permissions.

   *Moderator Permissions*: These permissions grant the associated users
   an ability to kick, ban, or otherwise restrict another user's ability
   to use the room.  For example, deleting a spammer's events.  The set
   of users with these permissions in a room are called *Moderators*.

   Note that with both moderator permissions and admin permissions a
   system may have finer granularity, such as a set of users being able
   to kick but not ban.  Documents with these semantics should clarify
   this case.

   *Invite*: An action taken by a user in a room to encourage another
   user to become a room participant (or joined to the room).  This can
   be explicit through the server-server API, or implicit with an join
   link/join code.

   *Join Link*: A machine-readable mechanism for a user to join the
   room, represented as a URL or QR code.

   *Join Code* or *Join Password*: A text-based string a user may enter
   to join a room.  The string may be shared with the user verbatim or
   encoded with a QR code, for example.

   *Direct Invite*: An invite to a DM or Group DM.  These invites might
   appear in a different section of the client's UI to denote their
   semantic difference from a non-DM invite.

   *Kick*: An action taken by a user to remove another user from a room,
   assuming the sender has moderator permissions.  The affected user can
   re-join the room with either another invite or by simply joining,
   depending on the room type.

   *Ban*: Similar to kicking, a user is kicked from the room and not
   allowed to re-join until unbanned by a moderator.  If a user is
   banned, they are typically not able to knock to get back into the
   room either.

   *Knock*: A request from a user (who is not currently a room
   participant) to join the room.  Upon acceptance, the requesting user
   may receive an invite or be directly joined to the room.  Upon
   rejection, the requesting user can be banned or otherwise declined.

   *Status*: Temporarily displayed text or images associated with a
   user's profile.  Instagram Stories are an example of a user's status.

2.1.  Diagram Reference

   In the simplest possible form, interoperable messaging between two
   end users looks as such:

+----------+       +------------+       +------------+       +----------+
|          |   A   |            |   B   |            |   C   |          |
| Client 1 |<----->| Provider 1 |<----->| Provider 2 |<----->| Client 2 |
|          |       |            |       |            |       |          |
+----------+       +------------+       +------------+       +----------+
     ^                                                             ^
     |                              D                              |
     +-------------------------------------------------------------+

   Figure 1: Typical, simplified, architecture for interoperability

   In this figure, Client 1 is directly connected to Provider 1 over A.
   A is a provider-specific Client-Server API and transport.  Similarly,
   Client 2 is directly connected to Provider 2 over C.  C is also a
   provider-specific Client-Server API and transport.

   Provider 1 and 2 talk to each other with a Server-Server API over a
   transport.  This is B in the figure.

   Clients additionally have an implicit method of communication (D in
   the figure) where they use a shared Message Format.  There is no
   transport for D in this figure: the figure is denoting that servers/
   providers are unable to assist with a format conversion due to the
   event's content (an MLS message) being encrypted.
